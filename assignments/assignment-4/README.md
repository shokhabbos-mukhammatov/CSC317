# Assignment 4: The Exciting World of JavaScript

## Part 0 - Environment Setup
This is Part 0 of Assignment 4: "The Exciting World of JavaScript", focused on setting up your JavaScript development environment. While this part will not be graded, it's essential to complete it before moving on to the graded portions of the assignment. The goal is to ensure everyone has a working JavaScript environment before we dive deeper into programming concepts.

## Required Tasks

### 1. Installing Node.js
If you don't already have Node.js installed:

1. Visit the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/
2. Download the LTS (Long Term Support) version recommended for most users
3. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system:
    - **Windows**: Run the downloaded installer and follow the prompts
    - **Mac**: Run the downloaded pkg installer or use Homebrew with `brew install node`
    - **Linux**: Use your distribution's package manager (e.g., `apt install nodejs npm` for Ubuntu)

4. Verify installation by opening a terminal/command prompt and typing:
   ```
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

   Both commands should display version numbers if installation was successful

### 2. "Hello JavaScript" Program
Create a simple JavaScript file (`/assignments/assignment-4/hello.js`) that:
- Outputs "Hello, JavaScript!" to the console
- Includes at least one variable
- Includes at least one function
- Uses at least one ES6+ feature (arrow function, template literal, etc.)

Example:
```javascript
// hello.js
const greeting = "JavaScript";

const createMessage = (name) => {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
};

console.log(createMessage(greeting));
```

Run your JavaScript file using Node.js:
1. Open a terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to the directory containing your `hello.js` file
3. Run the file with:
   ```
   node hello.js
   ```
4. You should see your output message in the terminal

### 3. Browser Experiment
Create a simple HTML page `/assignments/assignment-4/index.html` that:
- Links to your JavaScript file
- Contains a button that, when clicked, calls a function from your JavaScript file
- Displays some dynamic content on the page when the button is clicked

Example HTML:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>JavaScript Practice</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>JavaScript Week 0 Practice</h1>
    <button id="greetButton">Click Me!</button>
    <div id="output"></div>
    
    <script src="hello.js"></script>
    <script>
        document.getElementById("greetButton").addEventListener("click", function() {
            document.getElementById("output").textContent = createMessage("JavaScript");
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### 4. Explore Browser DevTools
- Open your HTML page in Chrome or Firefox
- Open the developer tools (F12)
- Experiment with:
    - Running JavaScript in the console
    - Inspecting DOM elements
    - Setting breakpoints in your JavaScript code
    - Viewing network requests

### 5. Enable GitHub Pages for Your Repository
Set up GitHub Pages to host your HTML and JavaScript files:

1. Push your files to your GitHub repository:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add JavaScript assignment files"
   git push
   ```

2. Enable GitHub Pages:
    - Go to your repository on GitHub
    - Click on "Settings" (tab in the top navigation bar)
    - Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section
    - Under "Source", select "main branch"
    - Click "Save"

3. Wait a few minutes for your site to deploy (you'll see a green success message with a URL)

4. Visit your GitHub Pages URL to verify your HTML page works correctly online
    - The URL format will be: `https://yourusername.github.io/CSC317/`
    - You may need to add the filename to the URL if your HTML file is not named index.html, for example: `https://yourusername.github.io/CSC317/index.html`

5. Make note of this URL as you'll need it for future parts of the assignment

## Part 1 - JS Calculator

## Overview
For this project, you'll create a fully functional calculator that mimics the design and functionality of the iOS/Android calculator app. This project will let you apply the JavaScript fundamentals we've covered in our first week, including DOM manipulation, event handling, functions, and more.

## Requirements

### Core Functionality
Your calculator should implement these basic operations:
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Clear functionality (AC button)
- Positive/negative toggle
- Percentage calculation
- Decimal point input
- Equals operation

### User Interface
- Create a grid-based layout similar to the iOS calculator
- Include a display area showing the current input/result
- Design should include:
    - Number buttons (0-9)
    - Operation buttons (+, -, ×, ÷)
    - Utility buttons (AC, +/-, %, =)
    - Decimal point button (.)
- Apply appropriate colors and styling:
    - Dark background
    - Light colored text
    - Orange operation buttons
    - Gray utility buttons
    - Dark gray number buttons

### Technical Requirements
- Use vanilla JavaScript (no libraries or frameworks)
- Create a responsive design that works on different screen sizes
- Implement keyboard support for numbers and operations
- Handle edge cases (division by zero, etc.)
- Implement proper input validation
- Use event listeners for button clicks and keyboard input
- Apply ES6+ features where appropriate

## Implementation Steps

### 1. HTML Structure
- Create the calculator container
- Add the display area
- Create a grid for the buttons
- Add all necessary buttons with appropriate labels

### 2. CSS Styling
- Set up the grid layout
- Style the display area
- Format the buttons (colors, shapes, sizes)
- Add hover/active states for buttons
- Make the design responsive

### 3. JavaScript Functionality
- Implement functions to:
    - Capture and display button inputs
    - Perform calculations
    - Handle special functions (AC, +/-, %)
    - Process and display results
- Add keyboard event listeners
- Implement secure evaluation of expressions
- Handle error cases


## Project Deliverables
- Complete HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
- A SUBMISSION.md explaining your implementation choices
- Host your calculator on GitHub Pages
- Submit the GitHub repository link

## Evaluation Criteria
- Functionality: Does the calculator work correctly?
- Code Quality: Is the code well-organized and error free?
- Design: Does it look similar to the iOS/Android calculator?
- User Experience: Is it intuitive and easy to use?
- Error Handling: Does it handle edge cases gracefully?
- Implementation of JavaScript concepts covered in lectures

## Tips
- Start by implementing the basic UI
- Add number input functionality first
- Then implement basic operations one at a time
- Test each feature thoroughly before moving to the next
- Don't worry about complex operations initially
- Use console.log() for debugging
- Consider using separate functions for different responsibilities
- Test keyboard input separately from button clicks


## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Node.js Installation Problems
- **Windows**: Make sure to run the installer as administrator
- **Mac**: If using Homebrew, make sure brew is updated with `brew update`
- **Linux**: You might need to add `sudo` before installation commands

### JavaScript File Not Running
- Make sure you're in the correct directory when running `node hello.js`
- Check file permissions (especially on Mac/Linux)
- Verify there are no syntax errors in your code

### Browser Integration Issues
- Check browser console (F12) for any error messages
- Ensure the file path to your JavaScript is correct
- Try using a different browser if problems persist

### GitHub Pages Issues
- Make sure your repository is public (GitHub Pages doesn't work with private repositories on free accounts)
- Check that your files are in the main branch
- Remember that GitHub Pages can take a few minutes to update after changes
- If your site shows a 404 error, make sure your file paths are correct and case-sensitive
- For repository-level GitHub Pages, your files need to be at the root level or correctly referenced
