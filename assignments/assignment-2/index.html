        <p>I'm Shokhabbos. Welcome to my page, to my story. I'm from Uzbekistan and currently study at SFSU. My major is Computer Science, and I'm junior student.
        I'm a passionate programmer and I love to learn new things, travel, sport and more things. In the near future I want to be in the field of AI and ML. It 2024-2025 AI
        broke all trends and hype. But it isn't easy as it looks like to make your own AI. I don't wanna like majority and just reuse already available AI models. I want to write my own.
        For that I definitely need to learn math and have dipper understanding of computer science.</p>
