I'm looking to create a CSS file for my portfolio website inspired by this image. I'd like to incorporate elements from the image such as its colors, textures, and overall mood into my site design.

[Insert your image here]

Please generate a CSS file that:

Uses the color palette extracted from this image
Incorporates the image (or elements from it) as:
A hero section background
A text mask for headings
Section dividers or accents
Pattern or texture elements
My portfolio includes these sections:

Navigation bar
Header/intro section
About me section
Education section
Projects section
Contact form
Footer
Please create responsive styling that works on both mobile and desktop. Include helpful comments explaining what different parts of the CSS do.

Additional styling requests:

Use modern CSS techniques
Create smooth transitions between sections
Make interactive elements (buttons, links) feel cohesive with the image style
Balance readability with creative design elements
Thank you!
