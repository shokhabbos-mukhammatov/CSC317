Please create a simple CSS file for my portfolio website inspired by Apple Inc. look and feel. I'm a student learning CSS basics and need styling for the following sections:

Navigation bar
Header/intro section
About me section
Education section
Projects section
Contact form
Footer
I'd like my website to have the colors, style, and mood that remind people of Apple Inc. Make sure the layout is responsive for mobile and desktop screens. Please add helpful comments that explain what different parts of the CSS do.

Some specific things I'd like:

A color scheme based on Apple Inc.
Easy-to-read fonts
Some simple hover effects on buttons and links
Basic responsive design (works on mobile and desktop)
Reasonable spacing between elements
See sample index.hmtl below.

Thank you!

Don't forget, I don't wanna change anything in the index file so, work with only what is present there
