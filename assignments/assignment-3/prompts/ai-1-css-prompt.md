Please create a simple CSS file for my portfolio website inspired by [INSPIRATION SOURCE] look and feel. I'm a student learning CSS basics and need styling for the following sections:

Navigation bar
Header/intro section
About me section
Education section
Projects section
Contact form
Footer
I'd like my website to have the colors, style, and mood that remind people of [INSPIRATION SOURCE]. Make sure the layout is responsive for mobile and desktop screens. Please add helpful comments that explain what different parts of the CSS do.

Some specific things I'd like:

A color scheme based on [INSPIRATION SOURCE]
Easy-to-read fonts
Some simple hover effects on buttons and links
Basic responsive design (works on mobile and desktop)
Reasonable spacing between elements
See sample index.hmtl below.

Thank you!
