# Portfolio Styling Assignment Analysis

## Analysis
In this assignment, I explored various CSS methodologies to style a portfolio website, including:

Hand-Written CSS: Crafting styles manually to achieve precise control over the design.
AI-Generated CSS: Utilizing AI tools to generate CSS code based on predefined parameters.
Hybrid Approach: Combining AI-generated suggestions with manual adjustments to refine the design. 
P.S. There was a lot of manual adjustment.


## Lessons Learned
If we talk about Hand-Written CSS, Hand-writing CSS gave me full control over the design and layout of the website.
I was able to customize everything almost exactly how I wanted.
However, this approach required more time and effort because I had to manually adjust styles and test the layout
for different screen sizes and there is still some things which I want to adjust.
But for that I need dipper understanding and knowledge of how to work with grid and scaling.

Using AI-generated CSS helped speed up the design process.
The AI provided a starting point with styles already applied, which saved time.
However, I found that the generated code needed a lot of adjustments to match the intended design.
It was useful but required additional tweaks to ensure proper spacing, colors, and responsiveness.

The hybrid approach was the best balance between efficiency and customization.
I used AI to generate the initial styles and then made manual changes to refine the design.
This method saved time while still allowing me to make custom adjustments.
It also helped me understand both AI-generated and hand-written CSS better especially scaling properly iframe. 

## Preferred Version
I prefer the hybrid.css version because it combines the best parts of both approaches (handwritten and ai-generated).
It keeps the structured and clean layout of styles.css while incorporating the design elements from ai-2.css. 
The result is a portfolio that looks professional yet visually appealing and cool.
It also feels more refined in terms of responsiveness and UX.
The hybrid version achieves balance, making it my preferred choice. 
It combined the softness of design from ai-2 CSS file and some structures from my version of CSS.
