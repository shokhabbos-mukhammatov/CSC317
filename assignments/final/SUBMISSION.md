## Reflection

Working on this group project was an incredibly valuable experience. Our goal was to build a full-stack web application that could intelligently generate custom travel itineraries using an AI assistant. This involved both frontend design (HTML, CSS, JS) and backend logic (Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and AI prompt engineering).

###  What I Learned:

- **Real-time Collaboration**: I learned how to break down a large task into manageable parts and coordinate with team members effectively using GitHub and project boards. We delegated responsibilities, reviewed each other's pull requests, and resolved merge conflicts in a timely manner.

- **Frontend-Backend Integration**: This project helped solidify my understanding of how frontend form inputs, user authentication, and route handlers connect with a backend server. I practiced working with RESTful APIs and sending/receiving JSON using `fetch()`.

- **AI Prompt Engineering**: Integrating the Gemini API (or ChatGPT) taught me how important prompt clarity is when working with generative models. We had to test and refine several versions to ensure the travel suggestions felt personal and logical.

- **Responsive Design**: I applied mobile-first design principles and responsive layout techniques using Flexbox, custom CSS themes, and component modularity. This ensured the app looked polished on both desktop and mobile screens.

- **Error Handling & Validation**: I improved how I think about validating user input and handling API errors gracefully. We added meaningful error messages to help guide users.

###  Final Thoughts:

This project combined everything we’ve learned in CSC 317 — HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, and AI — into one cohesive product. I’m proud of how functional and user-friendly our application turned out. Most importantly, I now feel more confident about working on larger collaborative software projects and tackling the full web development lifecycle from planning to deployment.
